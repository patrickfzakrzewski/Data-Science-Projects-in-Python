# Data Science Algorithms in Python
Various statistical analysis methods performed on real data sets Taken from Jose Portilla's in-depth machine learning bootcamp. Projects were broken down step-wise and solved by me, then verified with Portilla's solutions. These are my solutions and may slighlty differ from Jose Portilla's. Intended for use as a reference for project structure and using various statistical learning methods in Python.
